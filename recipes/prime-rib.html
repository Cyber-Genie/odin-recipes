        <h2><em>Prime Rib</em>that's perfectly pink and delicious.</h2>
        <p> If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you. Here are some tips from Chef John to get you started</p>
        <h3>Ingredient's</h3>
        <ul>
            <strong>Prime Rib</strong><p>: 1 (4 pound) bone-in prime rib roast (room temperature).</p>
            <strong>Butter</strong><p>: Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened.</p>
            <strong>Ground Black Pepper</strong><p>: 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
            <strong>Herbs</strong><p>: 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence.</p>
            <strong>kosher salt to taste</strong>
        </ul>
        <h4>How To Make The Dish</h4>
        <ol>
            <strong>Step 1</strong><p>: Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours. </p>
            <strong>Step 2</strong><p>: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</p>
            <strong>Step 3</strong><p>: Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.</p>
            <strong>Step 4</strong><p>: Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)</p>
            <strong>Step 5</strong><p>: Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.</p>
            <strong>Step 6</strong><p>: Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</p>
        </ol>
